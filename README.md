# Nearest-neighbor-model_2022

## Introduction

This is the collections of data fitting scripts in the paper of [Li, Weicheng, Norris, Andrew N, *et al*, *Protein science* (2022)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pro.4424). 

It includes the scripts of:

1. Quadratic curve fitting for CD binding data (Fig 3a)
2. One-site binding model fitting for ITC titration data via *itcsimlib* (Fig 3b)
3. Quadratic curve fitting for concentration correction (Fig S6)
4. NN model simulations of bound population distributions via *itcsimlib* (Fig 2b)
5. NN model simulations of bound fractional saturations via *itcsimlib* (Fig 2c)
6. NN model data fitting of native Mass Spectra (nMS) titration via *itcsimlib* (Fig 4b)
7. NN model predictions of cellular protein saturations via *itcsimlib* (Fig 5d)

Note: *[itcsimlib](https://github.com/elihuihms/itcsimlib)* is the python module that helps to fit the thermodynamic binding data via statistical mechanics model. The statistical thermodynamic model can be easily self-designed and automatically computed and displayed in itcsimlib.


More scripts will be updated in the future. Feel free to comment here or contact me.


## Requirements
